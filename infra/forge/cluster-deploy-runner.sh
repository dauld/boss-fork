# cluster-deploy-runner — converge the cluster onto forge main.
#
# The deployment half of the forge shipping protocol (directive
# 27ab7680): the conductor merges CI-green trains into forge main;
# this runner, on the forge host, notices main moved, builds the
# all-in-one image, pushes it to the forge registry, applies the
# tree's cluster manifests (infra/cluster/manifests/), and rolls the
# cluster deployment. Derived state reconverging on intent
# (deployment-as-network) — no ssh from the conductor, no shared
# credentials: each side touches only what it owns. Cluster config
# converges on forge main exactly like code does; hand-applied
# changes are drift (see infra/cluster/manifests/README.md).
#
# Install (forge host):
#   sudo cp infra/forge/cluster-deploy-runner.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
#   sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now cluster-deploy-runner.timer
#
# Expects: a clone at $REPO with a `forgejo` remote; rootless docker
# (lingering enabled) logged into the registry; a kubeconfig at
# $KUBECONFIG_PATH; kubectl via the alpine/k8s container.

# Run from a SNAPSHOT, never from the file this script is about to
# rewrite.
#
# This script lives inside $REPO, and a few lines below it runs
# `git checkout "$HEAD"` on that same repo. Bash does not read a script
# into memory; it reads incrementally and remembers a BYTE OFFSET. So
# when git replaces the file underneath a running invocation, bash
# carries on reading the new contents from the old offset — resuming
# mid-token, skipping a command, or executing a fragment of a line that
# happens to be syntactically valid. The failure is silent, unrepeatable
# and shaped by how much the diff moved the bytes, which makes it close
# to undiagnosable from the outcome alone.
#
# It has not bitten yet only because the file changed rarely and the
# offsets happened to survive. That is luck, not a property.
#
# `exec` into a copy makes the executing file structurally incapable of
# being rewritten: git can do whatever it likes to $REPO afterwards,
# because the bytes bash is reading are no longer reachable from there.
# The env var is the recursion guard and also carries the path so the
# snapshot can clean itself up on the way out — the trap belongs in the
# snapshot's own process, since `exec` replaces this one and would never
# run a trap set here.

# StepPlugin bundles converge from the tree too (job d35aec77).
# Code converges in the image, config in the manifests above, schema
# in boss-init — but the `step-plugins` ConfigMap was built by a
# kubectl command someone ran by hand, so it converged with nothing.
# Adding a bundle to infra/step-plugins/ and landing a train delivered
# NOTHING: the row at /system/step-plugins pointed at a file that was
# never mounted, and the step rendered "No plugin registered" with no
# error anywhere. That is how seven seeded plugins came to be active
# with absent bundles, blocking eleven ready review-design steps.
#
# Regenerated from the directory every converge, so the mounted
# bundles are whatever the tree says. --dry-run=client | apply keeps
# it idempotent; README.md is excluded because it is documentation,
# not a bundle. Deliberately NOT committed as a manifest: it is a
# derived artifact whose sources are already in tree, and a committed
# copy would be the second definition that drifts (§9a).

# `-i`, and that single flag is the whole bug this replaces. The first
# version piped the generated ConfigMap into `$K apply -f -`, but $K is
# `docker run --rm` with no `-i`, so the container never attached
# stdin: apply read an empty document, said "error: no objects passed
# to apply", and the generator died with "write /dev/stdout: broken
# pipe". The runner has failed on every tick since — silently, because
# a failed systemd oneshot notifies nobody — leaving the cluster on the
# placeholder tag committed in boss.yaml while forge main moved on.
#
# The lesson is the one from the zsh/bash mixup earlier the same day:
# a command validated in a different environment than the one that
# runs it has not been validated. I checked the kubectl invocation
# against my own kubectl and never against the docker wrapper it
# actually runs through.
