//! Brewery operating-engine library — shared between the

//! - [`run_brewery`] — convenience wrapper that uses
//!   [`InMemoryOutput`] and returns it for assertion-style use
//!   (test fixtures, the CLI's default mode).
//! - [`run_brewery_into`] — generic-output variant for running
//!   against a [`LiveApiOutput`] pointed at a real API stack so

//!   `PgAuditWriter`. The 12-month seed-generation path uses
//!   this.
