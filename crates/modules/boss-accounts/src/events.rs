//! Domain event subjects for account operations.
//!
//! Wire format renamed during the boss-accounts carve-out:
//! `people.account.*` → `accounts.account.*`. Audit-log
//! consumers + NATS subscribers parse these subjects loosely
//! (substring or prefix match) so the rename doesn't break
//! existing dashboards. Strict subscribers should listen on
//! `accounts.>` going forward.
//!
//! Per `docs/design/projection-rebuilders.md`:
//! - `created` / `updated` carry the full `AccountWithContacts`
//!   payload (account row + every contact) and drive rebuild of
//!   both `accounts` and `account_contacts` projections.
//! - `deleted` carries `{id, deleted_at}`.
