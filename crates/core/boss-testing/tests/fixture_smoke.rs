//! The shared-fixture smoke: does the test harness itself still stand up?
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT RUNS FIRST. Measured across the forge's
//! whole CI history on 2026-08-15 (106 runs, 36 trains): 79% of train
//! reds surfaced only in `test` — 23 of 29 stage failures, against 5 in
//! `fast` and 1 in `locomotive`. A train that goes green first time
//! reaches main in 0.54h; one that reds takes 1.91h.
//!
//! The expensive reds were not a crate's own logic failing. They were
//! the SHARED fixture failing, which reds every DB-backed crate at once:
//!
//!   * a registry migration that INSERTed the new active row BEFORE
//!     retiring the old one, against a plain partial unique index — so
//!     the schema load died and every DB-backed test in the workspace
//!     aborted, nowhere near the migration;
//!   * a `TestDb` guard that refused to run against a server hosting a
//!     database named `boss` — which CI's own Postgres service is
//!     created as — so all 11 `boss-accounts` tests panicked at the
//!     same line of the harness.
//!
//! Neither is visible to `infra/gate.sh -p <crate>`, the per-crate gate
//! an agent runs before pushing a car. That gate answers "did I break
//! my crate". These break everyone's fixture, and the blast radius is
//! the whole consist: today's trains carry 12-13 cars, so one fixture
//! defect blocks a dozen unrelated changes for a full CI cycle.
//!
//! So this test builds the fixture once and asserts it is real. It runs
//! as the first step of the `test` job, ahead of the workspace gate:
//! the compile it needs is compile the gate needs anyway, so it costs a
//! green train nothing, and it names a broken fixture in the first
//! minutes instead of at minute nine or twenty.
//!
//! Keep it cheap and keep it about the FIXTURE. Anything that tests a
//! crate's behaviour belongs in that crate.

/// The whole shared fixture, end to end: the harness agrees to run, the
/// schema directory loads in order, and the tables the rest of the suite
/// assumes are actually there.
