//! Boot-time guards every Boss service binary should use.
//!
//! The pattern: each service crate has an in-memory repo for tests
//! and a Postgres repo behind `#[cfg(feature = "postgres")]`. A binary
//! built **without** the `postgres` feature in error (e.g. the deploy
//! script forgot the flag) would otherwise silently serve in-memory
//! data — every write landing in a process-local map and disappearing
//! on restart, a degradation invisible to operators until something
//! observable breaks downstream.
//!
//! [`require_postgres_or_explicit_inmemory`] is the load-bearing
//! guard. Call it from each service's `main()` on the
//! `#[cfg(not(feature = "postgres"))]` branch — it errors out with a
//! clear remediation message unless the operator explicitly opts in
//! by setting `BOSS_ALLOW_INMEMORY=1` (test harnesses, dev shells).

/// Refuse to serve in-memory unless the operator explicitly opts in.
